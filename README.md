# Support_Vector_Regression
In SVR, our goal is that the errors do not exceed the threshold.
We are trying to decide a boundary at 'e' distance such that the points closest to the original hyperplane or the support vectors are within the boundary lines.

Building a SVR:
1. Collect a training set.
2. Choose a kernel and it's parameters as well as any regularization required.
3. Form a correlation matrix.
4. Train your machine, exactly or approximately, to get contradiction coefficients.
5. Use those coefficients to create your estimator.
